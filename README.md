For Hard Board generation:
    1) Run 'python testHardBoard.py' in python environment
    2) This file take very long to run, as it is evaluating each configuration of the board for how many mines there are.
    3) Note: Our testing only goes up to dim = 15, rather than the 25 in the testing code.
    4) The first figure should appear in a matter of minutes but each subsequent dimension takes much longer to complete than the previous.
